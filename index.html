        <h2>Hello! This is Christian Pascua.</h2>
        <p>You can just call me <b>Christian</b>. I am currently taking BS Computer Science at the University of the Philippines-Los Ba√±os.</p>
        <p>So far, my favorite CMSC subject is <b>CMSC 22</b> which I just took last semester. It's the course where we were introduced to the Java programming language. The exercises are really well-made and are so fun to do, such as the Minesweeper game we made in our last lab exercise! </p>
        <p>On the other hand, my favorite GE subject must be <b>Ethics 1</b> which I took on my first semester here in UP. This course really opened up my mind about the morality of the things we do that seem innocuous on the surface. In addition, it was also interesing to hear differing opinions from major philosophers regarding the question, "How to live a good life?"</p>
        <p>My favorite programming language is <b>R</b>. I have always been lacking in my mathematical skills and that's why I was really enamored when I learned about the capabilities of this programming language.</p>
        <p>I'm not really picky when it comes to food and I have a LOT of favorites but for the sake of having an answer I guess it's gotta be <b>pizzas</b>. All pizzas are simply delicious. <s>(Yes, even the ones from Czyrah's, Cha-cha's, and the like.)</s></p>
        <p>My hobbies are just the usual stuff such as <b>listening to music and watching movies</b>. I also recently got into the habit of <b>listening to podcasts</b>. I especially like the ones about philosophy and linguistics.</p>
        <p>Since I was a little boy I have always been fascinated about technology, but I was not sure if I wanted to get into the software or hardware side. Luckily, I got into <b>android modding</b> in high school so that became an easy decision.</p>
